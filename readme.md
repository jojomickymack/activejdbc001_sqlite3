## active_jdbc001_sqlite3

this hello world project uses gradle to load dependencies and anticipates a sqlite3 db in the root of the project called 'db.sqlite' with a table called 'cats' having a primary auto-incrementing column id, and text columns 'name' and 'color'.

note: sqlite3 doesn't have users, the username and password in the connection string is ignored.
